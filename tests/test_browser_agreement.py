"""The browser runtime and this package agree, frame for frame, on the toy game.

The test builds everything from nothing: the toy game, stand-in models, seven generated frames
and a release for each (``cardvision build-bank`` and ``build-release``). Each frame goes
through ``cardvision infer`` and through the TypeScript pipeline of ``browser/``, which loads
the same release with its own loader and runs under Node on ONNX Runtime Web's WebAssembly
backend (``browser/node/agreement.ts``). The two answers must be the same:

* the same boxes in the same order, with the same class and detector score, and the same
  coordinates to the last bit: both sides decode the detector's rows in the same precision and
  clip a box in the same way. ``cardvision infer`` prints a box rounded to three decimals, and
  the printed box is checked as well. Equality to the last bit is a property of the toy model:
  its stand-in detector returns the rows it was built with, whatever the runtime. With real
  weights the two ONNX Runtime builds give detector scores that agree to about 0.00001, and
  what must match is the boxes there are, their order and class, the names and the decisions;
* for every face the same accept decision, look, best match and name; similarity and margin
  to 0.00001, because the two ONNX Runtime builds and the two dot products do not round alike
  in the last bits;
* for a grid of pointer positions, under each of the three hover selections, the same box hit
  and the same card shown.

Three frames hold cards at all four quarter turns (so the rotation retry runs), a card back, a
card the bank lacks, a card the bank cannot tell from another, alternate printings, boxes that
overlap, a box inside another, boxes that hang over the edge, one too small and one too weak.
One release turns the rotation retry off.

Four more frames put box edges beside whole pixels, where the first or last column or row of
a crop is decided: a hair under (single-precision arithmetic leaves 299.99998 for 300), 0.0003
px under, 0.0003 px over, and far edges only (a bottom edge at 163.99988, where the printed top
and the printed height add up to 164). Both sides cut a crop from the box as the detector
decoded it, the near edges and the far ones, and round nothing before the cut, so they cut the
same pixels. A crop cut from the printed box would start or end one pixel away in every one of
these frames but the third; scores then differed by 0.0003 to 0.0033 when that was tried,
where 0.00001 is allowed. A pointer between a decoded edge and the printed one would be answered
differently in the second, the third and the fourth.

One frame more is of a game where different cards share a name. Its catalog states
``"identity": "printing"``: two cards named alike are two identities, and an alternate printing
belongs to the card it reprints. Two of its cards share a name and a picture, so the margin of
the accept rule is measured between them and neither is named. Both sides must read the rule
from the release and agree there as well.

The test is skipped when Node or ``browser/node_modules`` is missing (run ``npm ci`` in
``browser/``). ``.github/workflows/browser.yml`` runs it with ``CARDVISION_REQUIRE_BROWSER=1``
set, which turns that skip into a failure, so that the workflow cannot pass without having
compared anything.
