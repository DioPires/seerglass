"""Frames are found by their own timestamps, at a constant frame rate and at a variable one.

Two kinds of generated video, and nothing downloaded:

- videos of constant frame rate, at the rates recordings and broadcasts commonly have. Here
  the frame for a time is the frame the rate names, and the tests check that for each of the
  first 300 frames, by time and by fingerprint;
- videos of variable frame rate, as a phone or a screen recorder writes them: a first frame
  that stays on screen for two and a half seconds, then frames of a sixtieth of a second to
  half a second. They are made with the ``ffmpeg`` program, as H.264 in MP4 and as VP9 in
  WebM, and the tests that read them are skipped when it is not installed.

The last tests take frames from such a recording as ``cardvision infer`` does, make rows of
them, and fetch the rows' frames from the same file.

Tests that read video are skipped when OpenCV is not installed.
